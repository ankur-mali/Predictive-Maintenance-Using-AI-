# Predictive-Maintenance-Using-AI-
An interactive dashboard for predictive maintenance of turbofan engines. This project leverages NASA's CMAPSS (Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation) dataset to monitor engine health, analyze sensor trends, and predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aero-engines.
